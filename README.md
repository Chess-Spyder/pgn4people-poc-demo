This repository is the code for a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) web app currently hosted on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). The app  can be visited and explored at [pgn4people.app](http://127.0.0.1:4991/).

__pgn4people__ is a demonstration, and proof of concept, of a new and better way to navigate complex chess games and repertoires. This web app allows you to play around with the __pgn4people__ concept using a sample PGN file meant to simulate working with a large repertoire.

Essentially the same code was previously implemented as a CLI command-line application at the GitHub repository [pgn4people-poc](https://github.com/jimratliff/pgn4people-poc).

Read the [README](https://github.com/jimratliff/pgn4people-poc/blob/main/README.md) at that project for much more discussion about whatâ€™s wrong with traditional PGN interfaces when faced with complex chess games and repertoires and how __pgn4people__ improves usability.
